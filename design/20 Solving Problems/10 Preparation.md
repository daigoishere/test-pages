# Solving Problems

Last week, we explored what design is, and how problem solving and design relate. This week, we'll look at clearly defining design problems and exploring the solution space.

## Reading

Karl Ulrich, [*Design: creation of artifacts in society*](http://opim.wharton.upenn.edu/~ulrich/designbook.html).

* chapter 3: *Design Problem Definition*
* chapter 4: *Exploration*

## Assessment

The questions below will be the topic of our next class on Monday. Students will read and comment on each other's work. <strong>Bring a printed copy of your report!</strong> After class, the reports will be collected and graded: 0pt, 1pt (pass), 2pt (brilliant) per question. Good feedback by a peer can also be awarded 1pt.

## Questions

The assignment below will concern any app you choose (not the same as last week), as long it is on your phone and you can test it. Preferably, choose an app that you really like or one that is really "meh" to you. Provide a screen shot and a paragraph description of the application. Use the concepts from the readings to answer the following questions:

- Make a list of needs that could apply to this app. Model it after exhibit 3-6 in the book. Reminder: "needs" are not features!

Note: if the question seem hard to answer for your chosen app, choose another one.

Secondly, imagine a yet-to-be designed app that aims to provide travellers with interesting places to visit around their current location.

- Create a detailed representation of the design space for such an app. Feel free to define a number of discrete options that make interesting differences in the potential design of the app.

	Use a visual or hierarchical representation in your answer so readers can quickly understand what you're thinking of. This might take a few tries to do in a nice way.
	
	Bonus point if you create a clear representation like "shed world" and provide a brief but convincing argument about why you chose the various elements of your tuple.

Looking at both assignments, it is probably safe to say the each of those should fill a sheet of paper (or more). Feel free to draw your answers instead of typing them.
