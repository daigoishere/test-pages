## This week's app

Whatsapp.

## Assignment

Evaluate this week's app using Nielsen's [Usability heuristics for user interface design](http://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/
). List <strong>10 problems</strong> with the user interface. You do not have to cover all heuristics!

## Format

Include the following information per problem; keep it short though!

- problem name
- heuristic
- description
- severity
- recommendation/critique
- screenshot (probably)

Include a reference to Cadence where needed, e.g. if used in description or recommendation.

## Assessment

Clear effort will result in 1pt and anything else will result in 0pt. However, you must provide exactly (not more, not less) 10 problems!

Good links to details from Cadence & Slang in your analysis may result in extra credit.

If having difficulty finding problems, feel free to contact the course's staff.
