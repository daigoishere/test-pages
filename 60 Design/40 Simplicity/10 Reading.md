# Weekly reading

Like last week, we'll read about interaction design:

* Nick Disabato, *Cadence & Slang*, chapter 3: *Simplicity & Clarity*

## This week's app: Facebook

This week's assignment concerns the *Facebook* app. If you do not have it, make
sure you get it.

Evaluate this week's app using a selection of relevant concepts in chapter three of Cadence & Slang.

Requirements:

- the goal of the evaluation is to describe and assess the app using these concepts

- use specific examples from the app to illustrate your assessment (you can use screen shots, too!)

- provide short definitions, in your own words (!), of the chosen concepts

- organize your document into a hierarchy that makes the document easy to read for someone who hasn't read the book

- do not focus on Nick D.'s advice ("don't do it this way") but on the underlying ideas of describing app quality

- make a coherent essay out of your observations

- as such, the document must show *your* understanding of the material

- aim for two to three pages of written text (excluding images)
