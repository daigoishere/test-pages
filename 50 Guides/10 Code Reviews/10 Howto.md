# Code Reviews

It is common to review code between programmers in a team, in order to make sure that everyone has a good understanding of what is to be made, and to make sure that team standards are being upheld. Having code standards allows each programmer to contribute to every part of the code, and to quickly understand parts that other people have written.

Your task is to review another student's mobile project and to suggest specific ideas on how to improve the code's design and style.

Design
: To what extent is your code written well (i.e., clearly, efficiently, elegantly, and/or logically)?

Style
: To what extent is your code readable (i.e., commented and indented with variables aptly named)?

To do this, follow these steps:

- Sit together with one (1) other student, go to their GitHub project page, and browse through the code. Try to make sense of how the project fits together, what classes there are and where all functionality is hidden. Ask a lot of questions.

- Meanwhile, try to think aloud and say what you don't understand, or if you can't find something, etc. The goal is that you show your partner your thought process when browsing their software project!

- Then, explicitly tell your partner where you think the code could be improved. Use this [grading sheet](rubric.pdf) and systematically go through all of the aspects that are listed.

- Your partner (not you, you just talk) should note opportunities for improvement in a file called `REVIEW.md`. This file should be added to the GitHub repository of the project. Make at least ten points, including for each the following elements:

	- Aspect of code quality (comments, decomposition, etc.)
	- Where in your code are examples of good/bad quality
	- How to improve next time

- Finally, switch roles with your partner, and have them review *your* code!  The goal is that you learn about your own code and to try to incorporate the feedback in your next project.

Mind you, this process takes a couple of hours in total! Be sure to reserve time to do this.
