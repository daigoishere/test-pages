# Style and Design

In the next few weeks, we will be reading about the design of applications in Nick D.'s epic (but small) work on *interaction design*. The book contains a *lot* of information, so be sure to take your time to work through it and definitely make note of things that you do not completely understand! We'll read the first two chapters.

* Nick Disabato, *Cadence & Slang*, chapter 1: *Empathy & Kindness*, deals with the question: who are you designing for?

* Nick Disabato, *Cadence & Slang*, chapter 2: *Consistency & Character*, deals with the question: how to make interacting with the product easy?

## Assessment

The questions below will be the topic of our next class on Monday. Students will read and comment on each other's work. <strong>Bring a printed copy of your report!</strong> After class, the reports will be collected and graded: 0pt, 1pt (pass), 2pt (brilliant) per question. Good feedback by a peer can also be awarded 1pt.

## Questions

1. The book contains a lot of advice. Some paragraphs tell you to design in a particular way or pose constraints on how to proceed. Now, some of the advice is targeted at the design *process*, while other advice concerns the *product* that you are designing. Provide a list of 5 pieces of advice (not mentioned in questions below) and include for each an argument as to why and how that advice applies to app design *(100-200 words, skip anything that does not apply to app design)*.

2. Disabato discusses product's initial state. Download two apps of similar purpose (that you normally do not use) and discuss difference between their initial state *(100-200 words, use bullet points, but show your depth of understanding)*.

3. In paragraph 2.8, the *context* of apps is discussed. An important property of context is that it is usually very different for different products. Describe three examples of context that are highly relevant to mobile apps.

4. Give three examples of some *affordances* that might be present in a university classroom.

5. Give three examples of *types of affordances* that can be found in mobile apps.

6. While some of the book is advice ("do this, do it like that"), the book also contains a lot of interesting terminology that is relevant when talking about the design of apps. Give a list of 5 concepts from the chapters above with a definition *in your own words*.

## Tip

If you are unsure if you understand the question correctly, or you think that it can be interpreted in multiple ways, just send an e-mail to your instructors!
