## Tutorials to get you started

Handling the Activity Lifecycle is a very important part in the development process. Therefore it is vital you have a solid understanding of how it works. Here is an extensive explanation of the Activity Life Cycle, which contains [a very handy walkthrough to apply the theoretical stuff](http://www.vogella.com/tutorials/AndroidLifeCycle/article.html).
