# Multiple Activities

This week we will talk about the lifecycle of an activity in Android as it is created, paused, destroyed, etc. We will learn how to create an app with more than one activity and launch one activity from another using Intents.

- Most up-to-date is the [activities tutorial](https://www.raywenderlich.com/116580/introduction-to-android-activities-tutorial) over at Ray Wenderlich's.

- Learn about passing data around between controllers: [this](http://www.journaldev.com/9044/android-intent-handling-between-activities-example-tutorial) tutorial explains shortly how it works.
