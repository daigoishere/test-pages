* chapter 1: *Introduction to Design*
* chapter 2: *Problem Solving and Design*

## Assessment

The questions below will be the topic of our next class on Monday. Students will read and comment on each other's work. <strong>Bring a printed copy of your report!</strong> After class, the reports will be collected and graded: 0pt, 1pt (pass), 2pt (brilliant) per question. Good feedback by a peer can also be awarded 1pt.

## Questions

The assignment below will concern any app you choose, as long it is on your phone and you can test it. Preferably, choose an app that you really like or one that is really "meh" to you. Use the concepts from the readings to answer the following questions:

1. In chapter 1, we see a *problem* defined as a "perceived gap in a situation or experience". User experience is a central concept in our course. Try to write a fitting definition of the word "experience" in this context.

2. Exhibit 1-2 in the text shows a caprese salad. Although it does not really solve an important human problem, it can be seen as the solution to "close the gap" in a user experience. Describe in what way this could be the case.

And now about the app you chose:

3. What gap in the user experience can you infer from the app's functionality? Define this gap or problem very precisely.

4. Is this problem uniquely solved by a mobile app? Can you find websites that provide a solution to the same problem? So, what is the added value of providing it as an app?

5. Do you think the app's designer understands the problem well? What are clues in the app's functionality to evidence presence or absence of understanding?

6. One important part of the design process is exploring alternatives. This can range from developing another product altogether to changing particular details within the product's design. What alternatives may the creator of this app have considered?

Finally,

7. Prepare and submit one discussion question about the chapters above. We will discuss some of these in class.

Aim for ~50-150 words per answer. Include a representative screenshot of the app in your document. The document has to be submitted, below, as a PDF.

We will provide detailed feedback on each other's assignments in class, so be sure to bring a printed version.
