# Native App Studio

*Edition: Spring 2017*

Today's applications are increasingly mobile. Computers are no longer confined
to desks and laps but instead live in our pockets and hands. This course
teaches students how to build mobile apps for Android and iOS, two of today's
most popular platforms, and optionally, how to deploy them on Google Play and
the App Store. Students practice using the platforms through a series of
programming assignments, and working towards a final project to show off
everything that has been learned. Students learn to write native apps for
Android using Studio and the Android SDK *or* to write native apps for iPhones,
iPod Touches, and iPads using Xcode and the iOS SDK.

## Prerequisites

You need to have finished Programming 1 and 2, or equivalent as decided by the
course's instructor. You need to be comfortable with programming, plus have
some experience with memory management, runtime analysis, design patterns,
databases, and basic data structures and algorithms. You need to have a laptop
capable of running either Xcode or Android Studio.

## What to do

We'll learn about mobile software development by understanding how mobile platforms are designed and what parts we should get to know and what parts we can ignore. We will separately study the theory of design as applied to mobile software development.

- Every week, you will create one **mobile app**, each one making use of the new concepts introduced that week.

- You are expected to **kickstart** the weekly assignments early, so as to make optimal use of lab and teacher time.

- **Lab hours** are available to you in order to get help with your assignments. You are expected to attend most, if not all, of the scheduled hours.

- You are expected to use **discussions** with the course's instructors and assistants to improve the technical and functional designs of all projects.

- All assignments have to be handed in **individually**, but you are expected to generously help other students during the course. 

- You'll also have **written** design assignments. Attendance in class on Monday is mandatory to get credit for the design assignment of that week.

## Grades

Final grades for the course comprise three major parts:

| part               | percentage | grading                |  
| ------------------ | ---------: | ---------------------- |  
| design writing     |        35% | score out of 5 points  |  
| projects           |        45% | score out of 12 points |  
| final project code |        20% | grade 1--10            |  

A student must submit the final project in order to be eligible for a passing grade, unless granted
an exception in writing by the course's instructor. No retakes are possible for any part of the
course.

### Design writing

In preparation for each of the Monday seminars, a reading assignment will be released. The assignment is accompanied by an assortment of questions. Besides handing it in by the deadline, you are to take to class a printed version of your answers to these questions. Deadlines are:

| no |     deadline |  
| -: | -----------: |  
|  1 | Sun    9 Apr |  
|  2 | Sun   30 Apr |  
|  3 | Sun    7 May |  
|  4 | Sun   14 May |  
|  5 | Sun   21 May |  

Before and in class, students will read and comment on each others' answers, and difficult questions will be discussed. After, the printouts will be collected for marking:

- 0 points: less than clear effort or quite unreadable language
- 1 point: a clear effort where answers show that you have read the text (expected level)
- 2 points: excellent answers that show close reading and making connections between texts

No more than 5 points can be obtained in total. Points cannot be earned without being present.

### Projects

Programming assignments build up quickly over the weeks, which is why it is not recommended to skip any of the assignments. To get points for an assignment, you simply have to demonstrate the functioning app and its source code during class. A fully functional app, implemented according to the requirements, can earn you either 2 or 1 points, according to the deadlines below:

| no | assignment topic        | 2 point deadline | 1 point deadline |  
| -: | ----------------------- | ---------------: | ---------------: |  
|  1 | linking views with code |      Tue  11 Apr |      Tue  13 Apr |  
|  2 | multiple controllers    |      Tue  18 Apr |      Tue  20 Apr |  
|  3 | lists and APIs          |      Tue   2 May |      Tue   4 May |  
|  4 | state and databases     |      Tue   9 May |      Tue  11 May |  
|  5 | model classes           |      Tue  16 May |      Tue  18 May |  
|  6 | online databases        |      Tue  23 May |      Mon  29 Mar |  

Feedback can be obtained in class while checking off assignments. You are encouraged to clearly ask for feedback that you need to improve your future work.

All students must ordinarily submit all programming projects to be eligible for a satisfactory grade unless granted an exception in writing by the course's heads.

### Final project

The last programming assignment will be checked off as usual, but its code will be subject to a close inspection on style, design and other factors of quality.

## Books

No books are required for this course, but the programming books below may be referenced from time to time to indicate useful sections.

- Bill Phillips, Chris Stewart and Kristin Marsicano, [*Android Programming, the Big Nerd Ranch Guide*](https://www.bignerdranch.com/books/android-programming/)

- Matt Neuburg, [*iOS 10 Programming Fundamentals with Swift*](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920055211.do)

- Apple, [*The Swift Programming Language*](https://itunes.apple.com/us/book/swift-programming-language/id881256329?mt=11)

## Collaboration

All work that you do toward fulfillment of this course's expectations must be
your own work. You may read and comment upon classmates' code toward
fulfillment of projects' code reviews but only for classmates whose code is
assigned to you by the course's staff for review. You may integrate ideas and
techniques that you glean from your reviews of classmates' code and from
classmates' reviews of your code into your own work, so long as you attribute
those ideas and techniques back to your classmates, as with comments in your
own code. You may discuss projects, including designs, but you may not share
*code*. In other words, you may communicate with those classmates in English,
but you may not communicate in Swift, Java, or Objective-C and such languages.
If in doubt as to the appropriateness of some discussion, contact the course's
heads.

### Quoting sources

You may turn to the web for instruction beyond the course's lectures and
sections, for references, and for solutions to technical difficulties, but not
for outright solutions to problems on homework or your project. However,
failure to cite (as with comments) the origin of any code or technique that you
do discover outside of the course's lectures and sections (even while
respecting these constraints) and then integrate into your own work may be
considered academic dishonesty.

### Regulations

All forms of academic dishonesty are dealt with harshly. In all cases we follow
the directives regarding fraud and plagiarism of the University of Amsterdam
and of the examination board of the Computer Science BSc programme. Find them
here in [English] and [Dutch].
