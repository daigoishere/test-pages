## Welcome to Wouter's meesterwerk
The following files and folders (+ contents) are required to run GitHub Pages:
- _includes/
- _layouts/
- _assets/
- _config.yml
- linker.md
- info/<insert .md file here> (this will become the homepage)

Format for folders should be <number><space><title>. The first layer of folders becomes the navigation-bar. The second layer of folders become the links in the drop-down menu's.

Title of the page can be changed by changing the variable title in _config.yml.
